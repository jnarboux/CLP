% The Drinker Paradox: in a non-empty group there is somebody such that,
% if (s)he is drunk then everybody is drunk.
% Since the Drinker Paradox heavily relies on classical logic it is not 
% a natural example for GL. However, it is possible.
% First of all the domain should be non-empty:

dom(a).

% The goal is:
% there exists x such that d(y) for all y whenever d(x).
% This is not a geometric formula. The systematic translation
% based on the tableaux method yields that the Drinker Paradox is
% a tautology iff the following geometric theory is inconsistent:

_ axiom d_cons(X)   : (d(X),notd(X) => false).
_ axiom neg_phi(X)  : (dom(X) => d(X),neg_psi).
_ axiom neg_psi_ax  : (neg_psi => dom(Y),notd(Y)).

% NB inconsistency is proved without a clause for goal!
