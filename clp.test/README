[ What ]

this is a small script to benchmark some provers for
geometric logic on a set of formulas created by M. Bezem
and J. Fisher.



[ Requirements ]

to run the script 'bench.pl' you need:

* Perl          [http://www.perl.org]
* clp           [http://code.google.com/p/clp]
* Java          [http://www.java.com]
* SWI Prolog    [http://www.swi-prolog.org]
* Vampire       [http://www.vprover.org] (the runtime must be renamed to "vampire" and be on the path)
* E             [http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/E/E.html] (the runtime eprover must be on the path)
* Colog         [http://johnrfisher.net/colog/] (put colog.jar in the folder "Colog")
* CL.pl         [http://www.cs.vu.nl/~diem/research/ht/index.html] (put CL.pl in a subfolder "CL". Remove the line containing "enabled" and "next")
* leanCop       [http://leancop.de] (Extract the archive into the folder leancop)
* Geo           [http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~nivelle/software/geo/] (The executable "geo" must be on the path)	

Perl needs these modules in order to work:

 Switch;
 Proc::Reliable;
 Getopt::Long;
 Term::ANSIColor;
 Time::HiRes;


this module is not typically installed:

    Proc::Reliable

to install it module through cpan:

    cpan> install Proc::Reliable

or on debian based systems:

   sudo apt-get install libproc-reliable-perl



[ TODO ]
